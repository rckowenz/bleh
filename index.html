    the darkness finally illuminated, the room became brighter as you filled the darkness. <br>
    the blood of your remains dripped from my body as i stared at your lifeless corpses.<br> 
    the silence echoed through the room. i wish you didn't lack apathy. maybe if you<br>
    cared a little more i wouldn't have severed your body into pieces, and decapitated your fucking head.<br>
    stupid worthless fucking cunt. <br>who  really cares now though...
    <br>you're now forced to be apart of me. you're fucking dead.<br>
    although it brings me, excitment and joy knowing that<br>
    im the only one you're now bond to be with...
    <br>it hurts to know you're no longer alive.
